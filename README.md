#Notes

### property binding

dispying something from the ts file to html

### Event Binding

doing something as some event occurs in html like click event

### Two-Way Binding

doing something simulateneously

#### ng-model can be used for two way binding

#### ng if is a structural directive that can enable or disable the the DOM elements

we just have to put true or false inside it
as soon as button is clicked we will make the vaiable true and that value and put that varibale inside the ng if
